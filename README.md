# note-taker

## Description

For this Module 11 Challenge, the assignment was to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. This application’s front end was already been created and we had to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku. The motivation for this project was for users to better organize their notes in a central location that they can add and remove easily and that will persist unless they delete. This project also help strengthen my back-end skills with using Express.js

## User Story
